## Welcome & what to expect

Hi, I’m **Sebastian Suárez-Solís** — composer-performer and doctoral candidate at CalArts.  
My practice lives at the intersection of **sound, light, and space**. This course runs most weeks in **two halves**:

- **Presentation**: practice, process, critique  
- **Lecture**: concepts, live demos, small exercises

Today mirrors that structure: this page (About & Practice) → then a **Creative Coding Micro-Lecture**.

---

## Origin story & positioning

- I came to music through percussion and site-responsive sound, then expanded into **lighting as instrument**, browser-based tools, and public-facing libraries.  
- I’m interested in **monochromatic light** for how it collapses color into **shadows and textures**, and in **systems that audiences can read** while they’re happening.  
- I value **clarity, generosity, specificity**: we make the interaction legible, the stakes visible, and the critique useful.

> Thought to keep in mind: *How does light change how you hear a space?*

## Three works (maps to course themes)

### 1) CONSTRUCTIONS — light-and-sound as instrument
**What:** Oversized light sculptures (e.g., low-pressure sodium, ST64 incandescent), custom bases, and live manipulation.  
**Why it matters here:** Treats lighting as a **time-based performance object**; asks how city infrastructure can become chamber music.  
**See:** [/works](https://cbassuarez.com/#w/constructions) → *Constructions*  
**Themes:** performance systems · audience agency · choreographing attention

---

### 2) Dex Digital Sample Library (DexDSL) — open access, CC-BY
**What:** A nonprofit sample library of **beds, textures, instruments**, plus residencies and education outreach.  
**Why it matters here:** Models **public tooling**, clean licensing, and sustainable open culture.  
**See:** [/works](dexdsl.com) → *DexDSL*  
**Themes:** authorship · distribution · community infrastructure

---

### 3) Optics & Photonics Music System — mapping sound ↔ light
**What:** A three-part system: (1) pitches mapped to **visible wavelengths**, (2) actuators controlling mirrors/filters, (3) a physical optics track.  
**Why it matters here:** Reframes orchestration as **beam routing** and spatial composition.  
**Themes:** mapping · embodiment · readable complexity

---

## Method: materials · systems · people

**Materials:** streetlights, mirrors, acrylic prisms, carbon fiber, wood; microphones & room acoustics; and the **browser as instrument**.  
**Systems:** minimal, **audience-legible** pipelines (signal flow you can point to); small, repeatable gestures; constraints that generate form.  
**People:** collaborators, guest artists, and **you** — students as co-designers.  
**Anti-patterns we’ll avoid:** invisible interactions, over-engineering, unclear goals.

---

## Live peek: `/sounds` (what you’ll see/hear)

- One short gesture: start → a single parameter sweep → stop (≈60–90 seconds).  
- Point out **what** changes (e.g., filter cutoff) and **where** in the chain it lives.  
- Goal: show how a web page can be a **performance surface** and a lab notebook.

> You’ll do your own small “gesture studies” later — not about being flashy, about being **clear**.

---

## Why this class: culture & expectations

- **Two halves, every week.** Present (show process, invite critique) → Learn (concepts, demos).  
- **What I expect:** show small, evolving work; give & receive **concrete** feedback; write down what changed because of critique.  
- **How we talk:** we name what is *working*, what is *confusing*, and one *specific next step*.  
- **What you can expect of me:** direct feedback, practical tools, and time for your questions.

**You belong here** if you’re curious about sound, light, systems, or simply like building things that others can feel in space.
