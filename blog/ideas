# IDEAS

> the proliferation of thoughtless creation, of art as a quotidian unskilled activity, and the corruption of the prototype of the artist are ultimately good and serve the people.

## Art & capital

- Dissociate the creation of art from capital. Stop treating longevity, fiscal value, and appreciation as valid drivers of artistic decisions.
- Art should not function as stock for the elite. Divorcing art from capital gives voice back to popular interest.
- Your walk to the park can be art. Any way you express yourself can be art. One of our most powerful tools — recording and imprinting on society — belongs to all of us. Your experiences matter.

**My role:** vulgarize accepted and reified notions of Western art traditions by injecting chaos and cacophony into readily understood forms — a kind of reverse colonization.

## Art is political

- Art, like other modes of information transmission, can impart ideas to those who encounter it and beyond.
- Diffusing the idea of art as an everyday practice decentralizes expression and relocates it from elite echelons into daily realities.

**The only thing required to do art:** do it.

## If ever given the chance to use art to…

- take from the rich  
- involve the community in creation  
- empower  

**Do it mercilessly.**  
Be as ruthless in pursuing material conditions as capital is in taking them away.

## Reclamation

### art is in need of reclamation

- of communal action and interest  
- of a deluge  
- of corruption  

**art is yours**  
**you are an artist**

Every interest should be directed toward divesting power from the systemically excluded. By injecting chaos and cacophony into tradition, a reverse colonization alights. It’s something you can take part in.

## Practice & community

Do without thinking. Reject academized forms. Make bad art.

As a corollary to systemic exclusion, those in power want to stay in power — and preserve the system.

> How can, through our differences and strengths (because of them!), we as a group progress and move forward? How can I contribute to my immediate community, both in the studio and beyond?
